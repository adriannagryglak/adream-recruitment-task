# Recruitment task no 1 

Website mock-up, coded almost pixel perfect to designsheet (1920px wide).
.than made responsive with help of boostrap 
.than added lightbox effect (gallery) and two versions of animated slider (website header) 

Finally deployed [HERE](https://a-dream-job-recruitment.netlify.app) 

Still work in progress !
Submitting form via Wordpress unfortunately not working despite response status 200,
Getting posts from Wordpress works, but not perfectly- only after clicking links.

For some reason (maybe because of webpack v5 no longer automatically pollyfiling, many packages seems not be working in this project. Tried fiew solutions to fix it, but with no succes for now.

If you encounter autoprefixer warnings, preventing from build, before "npm start" run:

### `npm preinstall`

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
